In order to run this example you just need npm. First, clone the repository. Then run `npm install` while being in the
project's root dir. Then simply run `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (and open the dev console).
You'll find the necessary description inside the `test.ts` file.

On branch `fixed` you can find a bit changed version, where the exports in `.d.ts` files are changed and it solves all the problems.
